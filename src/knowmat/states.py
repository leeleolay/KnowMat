"""
Definition of the shared state used by the KnowMat 2.0 LangGraph workflow.

The state is a TypedDict with optional fields that are progressively
populated as the pipeline advances.  Each node in the LangGraph will
receive a copy of the state and return a dictionary of updates.  The
graph merges these updates into the existing state.

Important fields
----------------

* ``pdf_path``: The path to the PDF file being processed.  Set at the
  beginning of the run.
* ``paper_text``: The extracted plain text of the paper with the
  references removed.
* ``sub_field``: The detected sub‑field of materials science (e.g.
  experimental, computational, simulation, machine learning, hybrid).
* ``updated_prompt``: The extraction prompt with adjustments suggested by
  the sub‑field detection and evaluation agents.
* ``latest_extracted_data``: The most recent extraction result as a
  JSON‑serialisable dictionary.
* ``run_results``: A list of dictionaries summarising each evaluation run.
  Each entry contains at least ``run_id``, ``confidence_score``,
  ``rationale``, ``suggested_prompt`` and ``extracted_data``.
* ``run_count``: The number of extraction/evaluation cycles that have
  occurred so far.  Used by the orchestrator to limit retries.
* ``max_runs``: The maximum number of extraction/evaluation cycles to
  perform.  Default is 3 and set by the orchestrator.
* ``needs_rerun``: Set by the evaluation agent to indicate whether another
  extraction is required.
* ``final_data``: The final aggregated extraction output produced by the
  manager agent.
* ``rationale``: A human‑readable summary of how the final result was
  obtained.
* ``flag``: Indicates whether a human review is recommended for this
  extraction.
